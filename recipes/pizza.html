            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water (around 110°F/43°C)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>

     <h3>Toppings</h3>   
         <ul>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>Sliced bell peppers</li>
            <li>Sliced onions</li>
            <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>Olives</li>
            <li>Any other toppings you enjoy</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Stir with a wooden spoon or mix with your hands until the dough starts to come together.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too sticky, you can add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm area for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) or the temperature recommended for your pizza stone, if you have one.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough to release the air and transfer it back to a floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal portions if you prefer smaller pizzas or use the entire dough for a larger pizza.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into your desired pizza shape (round, rectangular, etc.) using a rolling pin. If you prefer a thinner crust, roll it out more; for a thicker crust, roll it out less.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough onto a baking sheet or a pizza stone dusted with flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add your desired toppings, such as shredded mozzarella cheese, fresh basil leaves, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, olives, or any other toppings you like.</li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

<p>Feel free to experiment with different toppings, sauces, and cheeses to create your perfect pizza. Enjoy your homemade creation!</p>
