        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds (1.8 kg) chicken pieces (legs, thighs, wings, or a combination)</li>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, pour the buttermilk over the chicken pieces. Make sure all the pieces are coated with the buttermilk. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight. This step helps to tenderize the chicken and adds flavor.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a seasoned flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to remove the chill.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. You want enough oil to cover the chicken pieces halfway.</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, dredge each chicken piece in the seasoned flour mixture, making sure to coat it completely. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot (around 350째F or 175째C), carefully place the chicken pieces into the skillet, skin side down. Be cautious not to overcrowd the pan; you may need to fry the chicken in batches.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken for about 10-12 minutes per side, until it is golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165째F (74째C). You can use a meat thermometer to check if necessary.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Repeat the frying process with the remaining chicken pieces if needed.</li>
            <li>Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful result.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Serve the delicious fried chicken hot, accompanied by your favorite side dishes such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, cornbread, or biscuits. Enjoy your homemade fried chicken!</p>
